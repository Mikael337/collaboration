## Alphaday

### Project Description

Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

We help solve the issue of information fragmentation and aim to serve as a central point where any user (whether they are a developer, enthusiast, investor) can instantly get the Darwinia Network information they need, stay up to date on the latest videos & podcasts featuring Darwinia Network and much more.

In general, users who can track their favorite project more easily, stay engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. Alphaday can also be used as an onboarding tool for newcomers since it aggregates all relevant project-specific data into one dashboard for visibility and ease of access.

Example dashboard:

Alphaday is and will remain free for end users for the foreseeable future. We only charge 0.1% fee for swaps executed via the Uniswap widget. In the future, we may include a ‘premium user’ plan for a small monthly fee (optional to users); the ‘premium user’ will have access to several more features, customization options, and widgets on the app.

### Additional Information

Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

We do not have direct competitors who are competing in the experience aggregator space but our individual widgets do overlap with features offered by Dune, Nansen, Zapper/Zerion, Coingecko, Discord, DeFiLama, Snapshot.

Bear in mind that the above are feeding data to Alphaday itself.

We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People using Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into our app so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.


Established partners: Aave, Chiliz, TheGraph, Avalanche, Sui, Reserve Protocol, Metis, Dfinity, Zcash, XRPL, Ethereum Classic, RocketPool, Starknet and others.

We are currently working on open sourcing Alphaday completely. This should take place in around 2-4 weeks.
